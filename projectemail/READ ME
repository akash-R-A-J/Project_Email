# AUED (Automatic Unwanted Email Deletion)

AUED (Automatic Unwanted Email Deletion) is a Java-based project built on Spring Boot that automates the deletion of unwanted emails from a user's Gmail account. It provides a user-friendly interface for managing and categorizing emails, with a focus on removing unnecessary clutter from the inbox.

## Features

- **Email Fetching**: Utilizes the Gmail API to fetch emails from the user's Gmail account securely.
- **Categorization**: Automatically categorizes emails based on their content (e.g., form, meeting, OTP, or other).
- **Deadline Detection**: Identifies emails with deadlines and calculates their expiration date.
- **Unwanted Email Removal**: Deletes unwanted emails from the inbox if they meet certain criteria (e.g., expiration date).
- **User Interface**: Includes a dashboard where users can view the percentage of unwanted emails and trigger the email fetching process.

## Technology Stack

- Java
- Spring Boot
- Maven

## Modules

AUED is structured into the following modules/components:

1. **ProjectemailApplication.java**: The main class responsible for bootstrapping the Spring Boot application.
2. **ProjectemailController.java**: Handles incoming HTTP requests and serves as the entry point for user interactions.
3. **DeadlineExtractionService.java**: Extracts deadlines from email content and identifies emails with time-sensitive information.
4. **ExpirationCalculation.java**: Calculates the expiration date of emails based on arrival date and deadlines.
5. **MailArrivalDateService.java**: Retrieves the arrival date of emails from their metadata.
6. **MailCategorizationService.java**: Categorizes emails based on their content, such as form submissions, meeting invitations, OTPs, or others.
7. **MailManagementService.java**: Manages the process of fetching, categorizing, and removing unwanted emails from the user's inbox.

Each module/component plays a specific role in the functionality of the AUED application, contributing to its overall automation and efficiency.

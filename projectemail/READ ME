# AUED (Automatic Unwanted Email Deletion)

AUED (Automatic Unwanted Email Deletion) is a Java-based project built on Spring Boot that automates the deletion of unwanted emails from a user's Gmail account. It provides a user-friendly interface for managing and categorizing emails, with a focus on removing unnecessary clutter from the inbox.

- **Categorization**: Automatically categorizes emails based on their content (e.g., form, meeting, OTP, or other).
- **Deadline Detection**: Identifies emails with deadlines and calculates their expiration date.
- **Unwanted Email Removal**: Deletes unwanted emails from the inbox if they meet certain criteria (e.g., expiration date).
- **User Interface**: Includes a dashboard where users can view the percentage of unwanted emails and trigger the email fetching process.

// **HOW TO CREATE THIS APPLICATION STEP-BY-STEP**

// public class Practice {
// I want to create an application which takes email from Gmail as input and
// then process it using my logic written in java to extract data from it and if
// deadline is found then also schedule its deletion and then shows the
// extracted data as output so for this which project type should I select
// ChatGPT
// For your application that involves processing emails from Gmail, extracting
// data, and performing logic written in Java, you can create a Spring Boot
// project using the following steps:

// Open Visual Studio Code (VS Code).
// Install the Java Extension Pack if you haven't already (refer to Step 2 in
// the previous response for instructions).
// Open the Command Palette (Ctrl+Shift+P or View -> Command Palette).
// Type "Spring Initializr: Create a Maven Project" and select it from the list.
// Select Maven as the build tool.
// Choose the desired Java version.
// Specify the Group Id and Artifact Id for your project.
// Add the necessary dependencies:
// For Gmail integration, you can add the spring-boot-starter-mail dependency,
// which provides the required classes for sending and receiving emails using
// JavaMail.
// For working with Gmail's APIs, you can add the google-api-services-gmail
// dependency. You'll also need to set up the necessary authentication and
// credentials for accessing Gmail's APIs.
// Additionally, you may include other dependencies based on your specific
// requirements, such as spring-boot-starter-web for building REST APIs or
// spring-boot-starter-data-jpa for working with a database.
// Generate the project.
// Once the project is generated, you can start implementing your logic for
// extracting data from emails and scheduling their deletion. Here are some
// general steps to follow:

// Configure Gmail integration:

// Set up the necessary properties in your application.properties or
// application.yml file, such as the email host, username, password, and port.
// Configure JavaMailSender to send and receive emails using the Gmail SMTP
// server.
// Implement email processing logic:

// Use the JavaMail API to connect to your Gmail account, fetch emails, and
// extract the required data from the email bodies or headers.
// Apply your specific logic to process the extracted data, such as parsing it
// or performing any business operations.
// Implement scheduling for email deletion:

// Use the Spring Framework's scheduling features, such as @Scheduled
// annotations or ScheduledExecutorService, to schedule the deletion of emails
// based on their deadlines.
// Implement the output functionality:

// Decide how you want to present the extracted data as output. You can choose
// to display it in the console, expose it as a REST API, or store it in a
// database for further retrieval.
// Build and run your application:

// Use Maven or Gradle commands to build your application (e.g., mvn clean
// install).
// Run your Spring Boot application using Maven or Gradle (e.g., mvn
// spring-boot:run).
// Access your application's endpoints or observe the output in the console,
// depending on your implementation.
// Remember to handle any potential exceptions, properly manage resources, and
// follow best practices for handling sensitive information such as email
// credentials.

// This setup will allow you to create a Spring Boot application that integrates
// with Gmail, processes emails, extracts data, schedules deletion, and provides
// the extracted data as output based on your specific logic.

// **************************ANOTHER IMPORTANT STEP***************************
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// the project is about the user login to my webpage then switch the button on
// if he wants to use my application and then my application automatically takes
// the email from that user account and processes it using my logic and schedule
// its deletion too if any deadline found and display the data on the dashboard
// of that page
// ChatGPT
// To implement the described functionality in your project, you can follow
// these steps:

// Implement a user login feature in your webpage, allowing users to
// authenticate themselves using their email credentials. You can use Spring
// Security to handle user authentication and authorization.

// Once the user is logged in, provide a switch button or any other mechanism
// for the user to indicate their intention to use your application.

// When the user activates the switch button, you can trigger the process to
// fetch and process emails from the user's Gmail account.

// To fetch emails from the user's Gmail account, you can use the JavaMail API
// or a library like JavaMail or Apache Commons Email. You will need to
// configure the email properties dynamically based on the user's credentials,
// as discussed in the previous response.

// Write your logic to process the emails and extract the required data. If a
// deadline is found, you can schedule its deletion using the same email library
// or Gmail API.

// Store the extracted data in your application's database or any other storage
// mechanism.

// Display the extracted data on the dashboard of your webpage. You can use
// Spring MVC or any other web framework to handle the rendering of the
// dashboard and fetching the data from the storage.

// Remember to handle exceptions and errors gracefully, and ensure that your
// application follows best practices for security and privacy, especially when
// dealing with user email credentials and data.

// It's worth noting that integrating with Gmail requires proper authentication
// and authorization mechanisms. You may need to register your application with
// the Google API Console, obtain the necessary credentials, and implement OAuth
// 2.0 authentication to access user emails securely.

// Please keep in mind that the steps provided here are high-level guidelines,
// and you may need to delve into specific libraries, APIs, and frameworks for
// implementation details.
